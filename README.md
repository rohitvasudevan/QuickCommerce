# QuickCommerce Full Project - Capstone Project

Develop an application that simulates a responsive and intelligent order fulfilment system, enabling interactions among the user's system, warehouses and delivery personnel hotspots. 

 The system must efficiently choose warehouses and hotspots based on proximity, ensuring timely and coordinated execution. Additionally, it should include personalised recommendations using prompt engineering and GenAI tools to refine logic and user experience.

Given below are the key features that the quick commerce application must have:
 

User Account Management: 
Users should be able to create accounts through a sign-up form and sign in securely to access personalised features.
Session management should ensure that users stay logged in across their shopping journey without disruptions.
 
Product Browsing and Cart: 
The homepage should showcase a list of products fetched from the database, allowing users to easily browse offerings.
Users should be able to add products to their cart, adjust quantities and review selections before proceeding to checkout.
 
Order Placement and Tracking: 
After selecting items, users should be able to complete their purchase through a structured checkout process.
Once an order is placed, users should be able to view the statistics of the order’s life cycle.
 
Smart Fulfilment Simulation: 
The system should simulate real-world logistics using virtual warehouses and static delivery hotspots based on x-y coordinates.
It should select the nearest warehouse and hotspot to optimise the delivery route.
 
Order Processing: 
The backend mimics the time taken for item picking and delivery using simulated delays.
The total delivery time is calculated based on the proximity between the user, warehouse and hotspot.
 
AI-Powered Recommendations: 
The homepage includes personalised product suggestions based on user order history and current inventory.
These recommendations are generated through AI APIs, enhancing product discovery and engagement.
